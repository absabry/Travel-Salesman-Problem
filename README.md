# Travel-Salesman-Problem
This is some algorithms  used to approximate the longest path of the traveling salesman problem applied to cities in France. We use an exact solution and two heuristic approximations for this NP problem. Finally we create a spanning tree with some indicated modifications and calculate its cost.
